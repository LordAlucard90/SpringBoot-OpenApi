## OpenApi Generator

The [OpenApi Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) supports a lot of different platforms 
for clients and server code generation.

## Java Client

On SwaggerHub, in the pase of the apo specification it is possible to go to `Export` > `Client SDK` > `java`
and a zip with the generated code will be downloaded.

## Java Server

In the same way it is possible to generate a server going to `Export` > `Server Stub` > `spring`.
